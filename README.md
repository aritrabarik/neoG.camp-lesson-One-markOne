# "Do you know me?" CLI Quiz App

- This app was made using [Replit](https://replit.com) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).

- I have also used the [readline-sync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/readline-sync) NPM Package.

- This CLI App asks 5 questions about myself and if the answer given by the user is correct then the score increments by 1, while a wrong answer makes no change to the score!

- If someone creates this app they'll learn the following:

  ```
  - functions
  - loops
  - arrays
  - objects
  ```
